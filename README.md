# Cloud Native Rust Experiments
Small experiments in writing Rust programs that work in a "Cloud Native" way, mainly containers, Kubernetes, Docker, and serverless (AWS Lambda).

## [Basic Container](https://github.com/keithsharp/cloud-native-rust/tree/main/basic-container)
Simple multi-stage build to create a small (79Mb!) container with a "Hello, World" application.  Uses Debian Bookworm slim for both building and running.

To build:
```bash
cd basic-container
docker build --rm -t keithsharp/basic-container .
```
To run:
```bash
docker run -ti --rm keithsharp/basic-container 
```

## [Basic Container Alpine](https://github.com/keithsharp/cloud-native-rust/tree/main/basic-container-alpine)
Simple multi-stage build to create a smaller (12Mb) container with a "Hello, World" application.  Uses Alpine 3.18 for both building and running.

To build:
```bash
cd basic-container-alpine
docker build --rm -t keithsharp/basic-container-alpine .
```
To run:
```bash
docker run -ti --rm keithsharp/basic-container-alpine 
```

## [Basic Container Scratch](https://github.com/keithsharp/cloud-native-rust/tree/main/basic-container-scratch)
Simple multi-stage build to create a tiny (4.5Mb) container with a "Hello, World" application.  Uses Alpine 3.18 for both building and Scratch for running.

To build:
```bash
cd basic-container-scratch
docker build --rm -t keithsharp/basic-container-scratch .
```
To run:
```bash
docker run -ti --rm keithsharp/basic-container-scratch
```
